### pylogenetic tree of the caninae subfamily 
using **mitochondrial reference genomes** as taxonomic markers
![tree_plot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43b58611-4fe7-46c8-916b-8374c429e899)

the choice of the mitochondrial genome is due to the following reasons:
1. it contains the CO1 region. see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_c_oxidase_subunit_I], under 'Use in DNA barcoding'
2. it is compact enough to carry out an analysis on a laptop
3. it is inherited only from the mother (therefore we do not have to account for the additional complexity of recombination)
    
to reproduce it refer to 'info/execution'
